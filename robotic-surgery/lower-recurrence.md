# Lower Recurrence with Robotic Precision

For hernias and complex reconstructions, precise closure and mesh placement can reduce recurrence. Robotic platforms help us achieve durable repairs.

## Hernia durability

Wristed instruments help with layered closure and mesh positioning.

## Handling scar tissue

Better visualization aids in removing or working around scar tissue to improve outcomes.

## Follow-up

Structured follow-up helps ensure long-term success for patients across West-Central Florida.

## FAQ

### Does robotic surgery reduce hernia recurrence?

Precision can improve closure quality, which may lower recurrence.

### Do you track long-term results?

Yes. We follow patients to monitor durability.

### What else affects recurrence?

Patient factors, mesh choice, and adherence to recovery instructions matter.
