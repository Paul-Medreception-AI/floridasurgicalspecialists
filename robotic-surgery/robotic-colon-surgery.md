# Robotic Colon Surgery

Robotic platforms support meticulous colon surgery with stable 3D views and fine control. We use these tools for diverticulitis, cancer resections, and complex adhesions when appropriate.

## When we use robotics

Left and right colectomies, sigmoid resections, and complex adhesions can benefit from robotic precision.

## Patient recovery

Enhanced recovery protocols, small incisions, and careful pain plans help patients mobilize early.

## Coordination

We align imaging, GI consults, and oncology partners when needed while keeping scheduling fast.
