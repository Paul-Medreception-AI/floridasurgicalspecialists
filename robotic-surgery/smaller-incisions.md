# Smaller Incisions with Robotic Surgery

Robotic approaches use a few small incisions instead of a large open cut. This can reduce pain, shorten healing time, and improve cosmetic results.

## Incision size

Robotic ports are typically 8 mm; fewer and smaller incisions can mean less tissue trauma.

## Impact on healing

Smaller incisions often lead to faster return to daily life for patients in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.

## Scar care

We provide scar care guidance to optimize cosmetic outcomes.
