# Time Off Work After Robotic Surgery

Robotic surgery often shortens time away from work. We tailor guidance to your job demands and procedure type.

## Light-duty roles

Desk work may resume within days, depending on comfort and lifting limits.

## Active roles

Jobs with lifting or physical strain may require more time; we provide clear timelines.

## Documentation

We supply return-to-work notes and adjustments for patients across West-Central Florida.
