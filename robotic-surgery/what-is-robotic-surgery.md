# What Is Robotic Surgery?

Robotic surgery uses advanced instruments and 3D visualization to translate a surgeon's hand movements into highly precise actions. At Florida Surgical Specialists, it is a tool that enhances surgical control and patient recovery.

## How the system works

Your surgeon controls robotic instruments from a console, gaining magnified 3D views and wristed tools that move with greater precision than standard laparoscopy.

## Why patients choose it

Smaller incisions, less pain, and faster recovery are common benefits for patients in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.

## When it is recommended

We use robotic platforms for hernias, gallbladder disease, colon surgery, and other procedures when it improves safety and outcomes.

## FAQ

### Is the robot performing the surgery?

No. Your surgeon controls every movement; the system enhances precision.

### Are incisions smaller than open surgery?

Yes. Robotic approaches typically use several small incisions, which can reduce pain and scarring.

### Does robotic surgery take longer?

Setup time can be slightly longer, but efficient teams often keep total time similar while improving recovery.
