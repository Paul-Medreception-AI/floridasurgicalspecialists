# Pain Control After Robotic Surgery

We use multimodal pain control to minimize narcotic use after robotic surgery. Smaller incisions and careful technique further reduce discomfort.

## Medication plan

Non-narcotic medications, nerve blocks, and targeted dosing reduce reliance on opioids.

## Activity and comfort

Early walking and supportive garments can reduce soreness.

## Local support

AI-answered phones and rapid nurse callbacks keep pain plans on track for West-Central Florida patients.
