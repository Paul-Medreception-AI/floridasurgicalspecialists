# Robotic Surgery for Large Hernias

Large hernias demand durable repair. Robotic platforms help us achieve tension-reduced closure, component separation, and accurate mesh positioning.

## Planning

We map defect size and create a strategy for closure and reinforcement.

## Technique

Wristed instruments aid suturing and dissection in tight spaces.

## Recovery

Small incisions and structured recovery plans support healing for West-Central Florida patients.

## FAQ

### Can large hernias be repaired robotically?

Yes, with careful planning and experience.

### Will I need a hospital stay?

Some large repairs require short stays; we keep them as brief as safely possible.

### How is recurrence prevented?

Precise closure, mesh reinforcement, and follow-up reduce recurrence.
