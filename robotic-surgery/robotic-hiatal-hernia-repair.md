# Robotic Hiatal Hernia Repair

Robotic hiatal hernia repair offers superior visualization of the esophageal hiatus and diaphragm. This helps reconstruct the hiatus and perform fundoplication or gastropexy with accuracy.

## Why robotic helps

Working near the esophagus requires precision; wristed instruments and 3D vision support safe dissection.

## Symptom relief

Patients often see improvement in reflux, chest pressure, and swallowing once the hernia is repaired.

## Follow-up

We monitor healing, swallowing, and diet progression for patients in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.
