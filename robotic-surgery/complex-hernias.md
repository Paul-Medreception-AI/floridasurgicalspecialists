# Robotic Surgery for Complex Hernias

Robotic platforms are valuable for complex hernias, allowing precise dissection, component separation, and mesh placement while working through scar tissue.

## Who benefits

Patients with recurrent, large, or multi-site hernias often benefit from robotic precision.

## Scar tissue management

Enhanced visualization helps navigate prior repairs and adhesions.

## Planning and follow-up

We design durable repairs and track healing for patients in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.
