# Robotic vs Laparoscopic Surgery

Both robotic and laparoscopic surgery are minimally invasive. Robotic platforms add enhanced visualization and wristed instruments that can improve precision and ergonomics for complex tasks.

## Visualization and control

Robotic systems provide 3D vision and wristed tools; laparoscopy uses straight instruments and 2D screens.

## When robotic adds value

Complex hernias, revisional surgery, and dense scar tissue often benefit from the extra dexterity of robotic instruments.

## Patient experience

Both approaches use small incisions. Robotic surgery can reduce strain and improve consistency for high-volume teams.

## FAQ

### Which option is faster?

Timing is similar with experienced teams; robotic setup can be offset by efficient dissection.

### Do both use small incisions?

Yes. Both are minimally invasive compared to open surgery.

### Is recovery different?

Recovery is often comparable; robotic precision may reduce pain in select cases.
