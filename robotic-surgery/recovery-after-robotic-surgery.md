# Recovery After Robotic Surgery

Recovery from robotic surgery is typically faster than open procedures. We outline clear milestones for walking, eating, pain control, and return to work.

## Day of surgery

Most patients walk the same day, start light fluids, and go home when safe.

## Week one

Focus on light activity, wound care, and pain control with multimodal plans.

## Follow-up

We schedule follow-up and remain available through AI-answered phones for quick responses.
