# Robotic Surgery for Obese Patients

Robotic systems improve access and visualization in patients with higher BMI, helping surgeons operate precisely with small incisions and stable platforms.

## Why robotics helps

Enhanced reach and control reduce strain and improve accuracy in thicker tissue.

## Recovery considerations

Smaller incisions can reduce wound issues and improve comfort.

## Local support

We provide clear guidance on mobility and follow-up across West-Central Florida.
