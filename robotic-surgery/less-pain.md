# Less Pain with Robotic Surgery

Robotic surgery often reduces pain by limiting tissue trauma and using small incisions. This helps patients mobilize sooner and rely less on narcotics.

## Why pain can be lower

Precise movements and small incisions minimize disruption to muscles and nerves.

## Pain plans

We pair robotic techniques with multimodal pain control for patients in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.

## Recovery milestones

Early walking and light activity usually begin quickly, reducing stiffness and discomfort.

## FAQ

### Will I need fewer pain meds?

Many patients use fewer narcotics after robotic procedures due to reduced pain.

### Do smaller incisions always hurt less?

They often do, especially with careful technique.

### How soon can I walk?

Most walk the day of or after surgery with guidance.
