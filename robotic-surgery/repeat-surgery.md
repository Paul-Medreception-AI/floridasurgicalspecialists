# Robotic Surgery After Previous Operations

Repeat surgery requires careful navigation of scar tissue. Robotic platforms give surgeons stable visualization and wristed instruments to operate safely in these settings.

## Why robotics helps

Better visualization and fine control aid dissection through adhesions.

## Common scenarios

Recurrent hernias and revisional abdominal procedures often benefit from robotic access.

## Recovery plan

We emphasize early mobility, pain control, and close follow-up.

## FAQ

### Is robotic safer after prior surgery?

Enhanced visualization can reduce risk in scarred areas.

### Do adhesions make surgery longer?

They can; robotic tools help manage them efficiently.

### Can recovery still be fast?

Yes, with careful technique and recovery protocols.
