## About Us

We established Florida Surgical Specialists in 2015 with one purpose in mind: Provide Southwest Florida patients with the industry’s most advanced surgical techniques. Our motto here is: "Big City Medicine, Small Town Feel." All of our providers have their roots in academia, and continue to hone their craft by participating in medical student education, attending major conferences, conducting clinical research, and publishing academic papers to keep current in  this ever changing landscape that is "Medicine." In doing so, our providers continue to deliver unsurpassed service to raise the standard of surgical care in Sarasota, Manatee, and surrounding counties.

In an effort to expedite and enhance patient recovery and outcomes, our surgeons use a multidisciplinary team that works directly with patients and their referring physicians to coordinate post-operative care, treatment and recovery. Team members are available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. to answer your questions and assist you with scheduling and other office services. Please contact us with any questions and use the button below to learn more about our practice.
