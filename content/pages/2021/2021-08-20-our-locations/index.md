## Southwest Florida

With multiple office locations in Sarasota and Bradenton, patients no longer need to travel far from home to obtain the best surgical care. For the convenience of our patients, Dr. Paul Toomey, and Dr. Alvaro Bada serve as a staff surgeons at three area hospitals: Manatee Memorial Hospital, Lakewood Ranch Medical Center and HCA Florida Blake Hospital. Outpatient surgical procedures are conducted at two local Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASC): Florida Surgical Suites located in Sarasota County, and Manatee Surgical Center located in Manatee County.
