## Our Providers

Our provider is Dr. Paul Toomey.  Dr. Toomey has advanced training in minimally invasive laparoscopic and robotic surgery techniques. By incorporating Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways,  we ensure minimal scarring, faster recovery, and less post operative pain. Outside of common general surgical issues, our group specializes in the treatment of complex hernia operations and colorectal disorders, providing local Sarasota and Manatee County patients with services that were once only available in larger metropolitan areas of Florida.
