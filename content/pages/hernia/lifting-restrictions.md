# Lifting Restrictions

Lifting restrictions exist for one reason: to **protect the repair while tissue heals**. Even when you feel better quickly, internal healing continues for weeks.

Florida Surgical Specialists provides clear, practical lifting guidance for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**.

## Why lifting restrictions matter
Heavy lifting can increase abdominal pressure and strain the repair, which can:
- Increase pain and swelling
- Slow healing
- Raise recurrence risk in some cases

## How long do restrictions last?
There is no single timeline for everyone. The appropriate restriction period depends on:
- Hernia type and size
- Open vs laparoscopic vs robotic approach
- Whether the repair involved complex reconstruction
- Your job and activity goals

Your surgeon will give a specific plan and weight limits.

## Tips for daily life while restricted
- Plan help for heavy household tasks
- Use proper mechanics for light lifting
- Avoid sudden twisting with a load
- Address constipation early to avoid straining

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you need a plan that fits your job and lifestyle, start with a surgeon evaluation.
