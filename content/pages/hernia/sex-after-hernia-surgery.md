# Sex After Hernia Surgery

It’s a common question—and an important one: when is sex safe after hernia surgery? The answer depends on your comfort level, your specific repair, and how your recovery is progressing.

Florida Surgical Specialists provides clear, practical guidance for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**.

## General guidance
Many patients can resume sexual activity when:
- Pain is controlled
- Movement feels comfortable
- You can change positions without sharp pain
- Your surgeon has not given specific additional restrictions

## Tips to reduce discomfort
- Start slowly
- Choose positions that avoid pressure on the repair area
- Stop if you feel sharp pain or pulling
- Avoid heavy straining early in recovery

## When to call the surgeon
Contact us if you experience:
- Sudden worsening pain during or after sex
- New bulging at the repair site
- Persistent increasing swelling or redness
- Fever or concerning symptoms

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you’re planning surgery and want clear expectations, we’ll walk you through it.
