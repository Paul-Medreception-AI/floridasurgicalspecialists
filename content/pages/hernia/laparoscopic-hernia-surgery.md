# Laparoscopic Hernia Surgery

Laparoscopic hernia surgery repairs a hernia using small incisions and a camera. For many patients, it can mean **less disruption to daily life** and a faster return to normal activity compared with traditional open surgery—depending on the hernia type and complexity.

Florida Surgical Specialists offers laparoscopic hernia evaluation and surgery planning for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**.

## Potential benefits (for appropriate patients)
- Smaller incisions
- Reduced post-op soreness in many cases
- Earlier return to many daily activities
- Ability to evaluate and repair both sides in some groin hernia cases

## Who may be a candidate?
Candidacy depends on:
- Hernia type (inguinal, some ventral/umbilical, selected incisional cases)
- Prior abdominal surgeries
- Hernia size and location
- Overall health and anesthesia considerations

A surgeon visit is the best way to confirm whether laparoscopic repair is the right approach.

## What to expect
Most patients:
- Go home the same day (depending on procedure and health factors)
- Receive clear lifting guidance
- Have a structured plan for return to work and exercise
