# Hernia Surgery Recovery

Most patients want two things after hernia surgery: **a durable repair** and **a smooth, predictable recovery**. Recovery varies by hernia type, repair complexity, and surgical approach (open vs laparoscopic vs robotic).

Florida Surgical Specialists provides clear recovery guidance for patients across **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**.

## Common recovery milestones (general guidance)
While individual plans differ, many patients experience:
- Day 1–3: soreness, fatigue, gradual increase in walking
- Week 1: improved comfort with daily activities; focus on steady movement
- Weeks 2–6: progressive return to normal activity with surgeon-guided lifting limits
- Beyond: return to heavier activity based on repair type and surgeon clearance

## What helps recovery go well
- Walking regularly (as instructed)
- Following lifting restrictions
- Good hydration and bowel regularity (avoid straining)
- Calling early if pain is worsening or symptoms feel unusual

## When to call the surgeon
Contact us if you have:
- Fever, increasing redness, or drainage from incisions
- Worsening pain that isn’t improving
- Persistent vomiting or inability to keep fluids down
- New, rapidly enlarging bulge

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you’re planning surgery and want clear expectations, start with a consult.
