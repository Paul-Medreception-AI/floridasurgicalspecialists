# Robotic Hernia Surgery

Robotic hernia surgery is a minimally invasive approach that allows the surgeon to operate with enhanced visualization and fine control. For selected patients, robotic techniques can be especially helpful for **complex, recurrent, or larger abdominal wall hernias**—and for repairs where precise suturing and reconstruction matter.

Florida Surgical Specialists provides surgeon-led guidance on robotic hernia options for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**.

## Why robotic repair may be recommended
Potential advantages (when appropriate) include:
- Excellent visualization of anatomy
- Precise tissue handling and suturing
- Ability to perform advanced minimally invasive abdominal wall techniques in selected cases

Robotic repair is not “better for everyone”—it’s a tool we use when it fits your anatomy and goals.

## Hernia types often considered for robotic repair
Depending on the patient, robotic repair may be considered for:
- Inguinal hernias (including bilateral or recurrent)
- Ventral hernias
- Incisional hernias
- Some umbilical hernias
- Selected complex abdominal wall repairs

## What to expect
Many patients:
- Go home the same day or next day depending on complexity
- Receive clear lifting restrictions and return-to-work timelines
- Experience progressive improvement over the first 1–2 weeks, with longer recovery for more complex repairs

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you’re being told you need “a bigger” repair—or you want minimally invasive options—get a surgeon’s plan.
