# Bulge in Abdomen

An abdominal bulge is one of the most common signs of an abdominal wall hernia. The bulge may be near the belly button, along the midline, or near a prior surgical scar.

Florida Surgical Specialists evaluates abdominal bulges and hernias for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** with modern treatment options and a clear, surgeon-led plan.

## Common hernia-related causes of an abdominal bulge
- **Umbilical hernia** (near the belly button)
- **Ventral hernia** (front abdominal wall)
- **Incisional hernia** (near a prior surgical incision)

Other causes exist, so an evaluation is the best way to confirm what’s going on.

## Signs it may be a hernia
- Bulge is more visible when standing or straining
- Changes size during the day
- Associated pressure, aching, or discomfort
- Improves when lying down (often)

## When to seek urgent care
Seek urgent evaluation if you have:
- A firm, painful bulge that won’t reduce
- Rapidly worsening pain
- Redness/warmth over the bulge
- Nausea/vomiting or significant bloating

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you’re noticing an abdominal bulge, get an expert assessment and a practical next step.
