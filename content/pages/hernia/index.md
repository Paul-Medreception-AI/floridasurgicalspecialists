# Hernia Care in West-Central Florida

A hernia is a weakness in the abdominal wall (or diaphragm, in the case of a hiatal hernia) that allows tissue to push through. Some hernias are mainly uncomfortable. Others can become **dangerous** if blood supply is compromised.

At Florida Surgical Specialists, we provide calm, surgeon-led guidance and modern repair options—including **laparoscopic and robotic hernia surgery**—with a focus on **rapid access** for patients across **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, Sarasota, and nearby communities**.

## When a hernia needs attention
You should seek evaluation if you notice:
- A new or enlarging bulge
- Pain with lifting, coughing, or activity
- A bulge that becomes firm, tender, or difficult to push back in
- Nausea/vomiting or severe pain (possible emergency)

## Your options: from monitoring to repair
Not every hernia needs immediate surgery. In some situations, **watchful waiting** can be reasonable. In many others, repair helps prevent progression and improves comfort and daily function.

We’ll discuss:
- Your hernia type and size
- Your symptoms and lifestyle demands
- Surgical options (including mesh and selective non-mesh approaches)
- Timing—when **same-week consults** and efficient scheduling make sense

## Why patients choose Florida Surgical Specialists

- **Robotic expertise** for complex and recurrent hernias when appropriate
- **Rapid access** with streamlined scheduling
- **AI-answered phones** to help ensure **no missed calls**
