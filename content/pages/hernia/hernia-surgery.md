# Hernia Surgery

Hernia surgery repairs the weak spot that allows tissue to bulge outward (or upward, in the case of a hiatal hernia). The goal is to **relieve symptoms, prevent progression, and reduce the risk of complications**.

Florida Surgical Specialists provides hernia surgery evaluation and treatment for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** with an emphasis on **rapid access**, clear recommendations, and durable repairs.

## When hernia surgery is recommended
Surgery is often recommended when:
- You have pain or pressure that affects work, exercise, or sleep
- The bulge is getting larger
- The hernia is difficult to reduce (push back in)
- You have a recurrent hernia
- Your hernia type or anatomy suggests higher risk over time

Some patients may be candidates for watchful waiting. The decision is individualized.

## Common approaches
Depending on the hernia type and your history, repair may be performed using:
- **Open surgery**
- **Laparoscopic surgery**
- **Robotic hernia surgery**

Your surgeon will explain which approach best fits your anatomy, prior operations, and goals.

## Mesh vs no-mesh (what patients should know)
Many hernia repairs use reinforcement to reduce recurrence risk. In selected situations, a non-mesh approach may be considered.

We’ll discuss the reasoning in plain language so you can make a confident decision.
