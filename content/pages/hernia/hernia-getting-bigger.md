# Hernia Getting Bigger

A hernia that’s getting bigger is a common reason patients seek surgical evaluation. Enlargement can mean the weakness in the abdominal wall is widening, which can increase symptoms and make repair more involved.

Florida Surgical Specialists evaluates enlarging hernias for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** and helps you make a confident, timely decision.

## Why hernias enlarge
Hernias can grow over time due to:
- Ongoing abdominal pressure (lifting, straining, coughing)
- Natural tissue changes with age
- Weight changes
- Prior surgery (for incisional hernias)

## What “getting bigger” may lead to
- More noticeable bulging
- Increased discomfort with daily activities
- Higher chance of tissue getting trapped (incarceration)
- A repair that may require more reinforcement or a different technique

## What to do now
A consultation can determine:
- Hernia type and location
- Whether watchful waiting is still reasonable
- Whether a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopic or robotic) is appropriate
- Timing, including options for **same-week consults** when available

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If your hernia is changing, get a plan while it’s still manageable.
