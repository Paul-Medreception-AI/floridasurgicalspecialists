# ER vs Surgeon for Hernia

Knowing where to go for hernia symptoms can save time—and in urgent situations, protect your health.

Florida Surgical Specialists helps patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** understand when a surgeon visit is appropriate and when the ER is the safer choice.

## Go to the ER if you have
- Severe or rapidly worsening pain
- A firm bulge that won’t push back in
- Redness/warmth over the bulge
- Nausea/vomiting
- Significant bloating
- Inability to pass gas or stool
- Fever with hernia symptoms

These can be signs that tissue is trapped and needs urgent evaluation.

## Schedule a surgeon visit if you have
- A bulge that comes and goes
- Mild to moderate discomfort that is stable
- A hernia that is slowly enlarging
- Symptoms limiting work or exercise without emergency signs
- A recurrent hernia after prior repair

## Why a surgeon evaluation matters
A consult provides:
- Accurate diagnosis and hernia type identification
- A plan for monitoring vs repair
- Discussion of minimally invasive options (laparoscopic/robotic)
- A recovery and timing plan that fits your life

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you’re not having emergency symptoms but you want a clear plan, schedule a visit.
