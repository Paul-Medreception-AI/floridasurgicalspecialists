# Hernia Symptoms

Hernia symptoms can be subtle at first. Some patients notice only a small bulge. Others feel pressure or pain with activity. Knowing what’s common—and what’s urgent—helps you decide when to get evaluated.

Florida Surgical Specialists provides hernia evaluation for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** with a focus on clear answers and rapid access.

## Common hernia symptoms
- A bulge that appears with standing, coughing, or straining
- Pressure, heaviness, or aching at the bulge site
- Discomfort during lifting or exercise
- Symptoms that worsen later in the day
- A bulge that reduces (goes back in) when lying down (often, but not always)

## Symptoms that deserve prompt attention
Seek urgent evaluation if you have:
- Sudden severe pain at the bulge site
- A firm or tender bulge that won’t go back in
- Redness or warmth over the bulge
- Nausea/vomiting, bloating, or inability to pass gas/stool
These can signal **incarceration** or **strangulation**, which can be serious.

## What to do next
A surgical consultation can confirm whether your symptoms match a hernia and what your safest path is—monitoring versus repair.

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If symptoms are changing, don’t wait for them to escalate.
