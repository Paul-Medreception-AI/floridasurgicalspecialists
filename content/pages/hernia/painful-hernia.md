# Painful Hernia

A painful hernia doesn’t automatically mean an emergency, but it **does mean you should be evaluated**—especially if symptoms are changing.

At Florida Surgical Specialists, we help patients across **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** understand what’s normal, what’s risky, and how to get the right treatment without delays.

## Common reasons a hernia becomes painful
- Increased activity or lifting
- Coughing, sneezing, or straining
- Hernia enlargement (more stretching and pressure)
- Tissue irritation around the defect

## When pain suggests an urgent problem
Go to the ER or seek urgent evaluation if you have:
- A painful bulge that becomes **firm** and won’t push back in
- Worsening pain over hours
- Nausea/vomiting
- Fever, redness, or warmth over the bulge
- Bloating or inability to pass gas or stool

These can be signs that tissue is trapped and needs urgent attention.

## What a surgeon visit can clarify
A consultation can answer:
- Is this truly a hernia?
- What type is it?
- Is watchful waiting safe—or is repair recommended?
- Which approach (open, laparoscopic, or robotic) best fits your situation?

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If your hernia is painful, you shouldn’t have to wait weeks for answers.
