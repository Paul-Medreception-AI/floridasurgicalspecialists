# Ventral Hernia

A ventral hernia is a bulge through the front abdominal wall. It can occur in different areas of the abdomen and may be related to natural weak points, prior strain, or previous surgery.

If you live in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, or Sarasota** and suspect a ventral hernia, an evaluation can clarify what’s happening and whether repair is recommended.

## Symptoms patients commonly notice
- A bulge that is more visible with standing or straining
- Pressure, aching, or burning discomfort
- Worsening symptoms after activity
- A bulge that gradually enlarges

Some ventral hernias are painless. Others affect sleep, exercise, and work.

## Why prompt evaluation matters
Ventral hernias can grow and become more complex to repair. Early assessment helps with:
- Defining the hernia size and location
- Understanding your risk for progression
- Planning the least disruptive, most durable repair approach

## Treatment approaches
Treatment may include:
- Monitoring (selected cases)
- **Surgical repair** when symptoms or risk justify it

Surgical options may include:
- **Laparoscopic repair**
- **Robotic repair** for selected cases, including larger or more complex abdominal wall repairs
- Open repair (sometimes necessary)

Your surgeon will explain whether reinforcement is recommended and why.
