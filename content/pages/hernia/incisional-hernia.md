# Incisional Hernia

An incisional hernia forms at the site of a previous surgical incision. Even after good healing, the abdominal wall can remain weaker along a scar, allowing tissue to bulge outward.

If you notice a new or enlarging bulge near an old scar, Florida Surgical Specialists offers clear evaluation and treatment planning for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**.

## Common symptoms
- A bulge near a previous incision site
- Pressure or pulling around the scar
- Discomfort with lifting or activity
- A bulge that grows over months or years

## Why incisional hernias can be more complex
Compared to some primary hernias, incisional hernias may involve:
- Larger defects
- Weakened tissue quality from prior surgery
- Scar tissue that affects anatomy

That’s why careful planning—often including minimally invasive options when appropriate—matters for durability and recovery.

## Treatment options
- Monitoring (selected cases)
- Surgical repair, often recommended when symptoms progress or the hernia enlarges

Repair may be performed with:
- **Robotic hernia surgery** for selected cases where advanced minimally invasive techniques may help
- Laparoscopic repair
- Open repair, sometimes necessary depending on size and prior operations

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If a scar-area bulge is changing, don’t wait for it to limit your life.
