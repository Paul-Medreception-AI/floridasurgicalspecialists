# Schedule a Hernia Consultation

If you suspect a hernia—or you’ve been told you have one—getting a surgeon-led evaluation is the fastest way to replace uncertainty with a clear plan.

Florida Surgical Specialists serves patients across **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** with a focus on **rapid access**, **board-certified surgical care**, and modern options including **laparoscopic and robotic hernia surgery** when appropriate.

## What a hernia consultation does
A consultation helps you understand:
- Whether your symptoms match a hernia (and which type)
- Whether monitoring (watchful waiting) is reasonable
- Whether repair is recommended and why
- What approach fits your anatomy (open vs laparoscopic vs robotic)
- What recovery looks like for your work and lifestyle

## What to bring (helpful, not required)
If you have them, bring:
- A list of your symptoms and when they occur
- Prior surgery history (especially abdominal surgery)
- Relevant imaging reports
- Your questions about mesh vs no-mesh and recovery

## When to seek urgent care instead
Go to the ER for severe pain, vomiting, a firm bulge that won’t reduce, redness, fever, bloating, or inability to pass gas or stool.
