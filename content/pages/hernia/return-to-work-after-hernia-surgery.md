# Return to Work After Hernia Surgery

Returning to work after hernia surgery depends on your job demands and the type of repair performed. Office work and light duty often return sooner than jobs requiring heavy lifting, climbing, or repetitive strain.

Florida Surgical Specialists provides individualized return-to-work guidance for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**.

## Factors that affect timing
Your timeline depends on:
- Hernia type (inguinal vs ventral/incisional, etc.)
- Surgical approach (open vs laparoscopic vs robotic)
- Size and complexity of the repair
- Your baseline fitness and overall health
- Pain control and mobility

## Common timeline examples (general)
- Desk/light duty: often within days to 1–2 weeks (varies)
- Moderate activity jobs: may require additional time and restrictions
- Heavy labor: often requires a longer restriction period to protect the repair

Your surgeon will give a plan that aligns with your repair and your safety.

## How to return safely
- Follow lifting restrictions
- Avoid straining and sudden twisting
- Ask about staged return (light duty first)
- Contact us if pain increases with work tasks

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If your job involves lifting or physical work, we’ll help you plan a safe path.
