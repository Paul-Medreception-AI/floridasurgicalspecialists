# Lump in Groin

A lump in the groin can be alarming—and it deserves a clear evaluation. One common cause is an **inguinal hernia**, especially if the lump comes and goes or changes with activity. Other causes exist, so getting the right diagnosis matters.

Florida Surgical Specialists sees patients from **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** for groin bulges and suspected hernias with a focus on calm, practical guidance.

## Signs the lump may be a hernia
- Appears when standing, coughing, or straining
- Improves or disappears when lying down
- Associated with pressure, ache, or pulling sensation
- Worsens with lifting or prolonged standing

## Red flags that require urgent evaluation
Seek urgent care if the lump:
- Becomes suddenly painful
- Turns firm and won’t go back in
- Is associated with nausea/vomiting or fever
- Has redness or warmth over the area

## What a surgical consult includes
A surgeon can:
- Evaluate the bulge and your symptoms
- Determine whether imaging is needed
- Recommend monitoring vs repair
- Discuss minimally invasive options, including **laparoscopic and robotic** approaches
