# Umbilical Hernia

An umbilical hernia occurs near the belly button (navel), where the abdominal wall can be naturally weaker. Some are small and only noticeable with coughing or straining. Others become larger and more uncomfortable over time.

Florida Surgical Specialists helps patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** understand their options and move forward with a clear plan.

## Signs you may have an umbilical hernia
- A bulge at or near the belly button
- Pressure or tenderness with activity
- Discomfort when lifting, bending, or exercising
- A bulge that becomes more noticeable after meals or at the end of the day

## When is repair recommended?
Repair may be recommended when:
- The hernia is enlarging
- Symptoms are limiting activity or work
- The bulge is difficult to push back in
- There are concerns for incarceration/strangulation

## Surgery options
Depending on size and anatomy, repair may be done with:
- **Minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery**
- **Robotic hernia surgery** for selected cases
- Open repair (sometimes best for small, straightforward defects)

We’ll discuss whether reinforcement (often with mesh) is recommended based on your situation.
