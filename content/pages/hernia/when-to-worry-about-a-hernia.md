# When to Worry About a Hernia

Many hernias are not immediately dangerous—but certain symptoms should never be ignored. Knowing what’s urgent helps you stay safe.

Florida Surgical Specialists serves patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** with clear hernia guidance and rapid access when possible.

## Warning signs that require urgent evaluation
Seek urgent evaluation if you have:
- Severe or rapidly worsening pain at the hernia site
- A bulge that becomes firm, tender, or won’t push back in
- Redness or warmth over the bulge
- Nausea/vomiting
- Significant abdominal bloating
- Inability to pass gas or stool

These can be signs of incarceration or strangulation, which can be serious.

## Signs that still warrant a prompt surgeon visit
Even without an emergency, schedule an evaluation if:
- The hernia is getting bigger
- Pain is increasing
- Symptoms are limiting work or exercise
- You’ve had a prior repair and symptoms are returning

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you’re not sure what your symptoms mean, don’t guess.
