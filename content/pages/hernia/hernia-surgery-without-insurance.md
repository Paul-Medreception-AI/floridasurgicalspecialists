# Hernia Surgery Without Insurance

If you don’t have insurance, a hernia can feel like a problem you have to “live with.” You don’t. Many patients can still get evaluated, understand options, and plan care in a way that fits their situation.

Florida Surgical Specialists helps patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** with clear next steps and rapid access when possible.

## Start with the right diagnosis
Not every bulge is the same. A consultation helps confirm:
- Whether it’s truly a hernia
- The hernia type and complexity
- Whether monitoring is safe or repair is recommended
- Whether minimally invasive options may be appropriate

## What impacts the total cost without insurance
- Hernia type and size
- Complexity (recurrent/incisional vs straightforward)
- Surgical approach (open vs laparoscopic vs robotic)
- Facility and anesthesia charges
- Pre-op testing needs

## Why timely evaluation can still help
Even if you’re not ready for surgery immediately, evaluation can:
- Clarify your risk and urgency
- Help avoid last-minute emergency situations
- Support planning for work/time off and budgeting

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you’re uninsured, start with a surgeon’s plan you can trust.
