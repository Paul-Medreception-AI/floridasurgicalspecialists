# Hernia Pain

Hernia pain is often described as **pressure, aching, burning, or a pulling sensation**—usually worse with activity. Pain can also be a warning sign when a hernia becomes trapped.

Florida Surgical Specialists helps patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** understand what their pain may mean and what to do next.

## Why hernias can hurt
Pain may come from:
- Stretching of tissue at the hernia opening
- Local irritation from movement
- Straining with lifting, coughing, or bowel movements
- Increased pressure after meals (common in some abdominal wall hernias)

## Red flags: pain that should be evaluated urgently
Seek urgent evaluation if pain is:
- Severe and sudden
- Associated with a bulge that is firm or won’t go back in
- Paired with nausea/vomiting or abdominal bloating
- Associated with skin redness or fever

## How hernia pain is treated
Treatment depends on the cause:
- Activity adjustments and monitoring for select patients
- Hernia repair when symptoms persist, function is limited, or risk increases
Minimally invasive options—**laparoscopic or robotic**—may be appropriate based on hernia type and anatomy.

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If your pain is recurring or affecting daily life, get a surgeon’s assessment.
