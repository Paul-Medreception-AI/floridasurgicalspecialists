# Watchful Waiting

“Watchful waiting” means monitoring a hernia without immediate surgery—**with a clear plan** and clear warning signs. It can be appropriate for selected patients, but it should be a medical decision, not a guess.

Florida Surgical Specialists helps patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota** decide whether watchful waiting is reasonable or whether repair is the safer choice.

## Who may be a candidate
Watchful waiting may be considered when:
- Symptoms are minimal and stable
- The hernia is reducible (often goes back in)
- Your overall risk profile supports monitoring
- You have reliable access to care and understand red flags

## What watchful waiting is NOT
- It is not ignoring a growing hernia
- It is not “living with severe pain”
- It is not delaying evaluation indefinitely

## What to monitor
Call or schedule re-evaluation if you notice:
- Increasing pain or activity limitations
- A bulge that’s getting bigger
- The hernia becoming harder to reduce
- Any emergency warning signs

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you’re considering watchful waiting, get a surgeon’s guidance first.
