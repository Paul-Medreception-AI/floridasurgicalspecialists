# Hiatal Hernia

A hiatal hernia happens when part of the stomach moves upward through the diaphragm into the chest. Some people have no symptoms. Others experience reflux-related issues that affect sleep, meals, and quality of life.

Florida Surgical Specialists provides patient-centered evaluation for hiatal hernia concerns for people in **Sarasota, Lakewood Ranch, and Bradenton**.

## Symptoms that may be related
Hiatal hernias can contribute to:
- Heartburn or reflux symptoms
- Regurgitation (acid or food coming back up)
- Chest pressure or discomfort (always discuss chest pain urgently to rule out heart causes)
- Difficulty swallowing or a “stuck” sensation
- Symptoms that worsen after meals or when lying down

## When to consider a surgical consultation
A surgical evaluation may be helpful when:
- Symptoms persist despite appropriate medical therapy
- You have complications of reflux (like inflammation or narrowing)
- There is concern for a larger hiatal hernia
- Symptoms are significantly affecting daily life

## Treatment options
Treatment depends on your symptoms and findings. Options may include:
- Lifestyle and medication strategies (often first-line)
- Surgical repair in selected cases, especially when symptoms are persistent or anatomy suggests benefit

Your surgeon will coordinate the appropriate workup and discuss whether surgery is likely to help.

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If reflux symptoms are ongoing or changing, get a clear plan.
