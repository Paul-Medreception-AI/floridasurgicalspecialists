# Exercise After Hernia Repair

Most patients want to get back to exercise as soon as it’s safe—without risking the repair. The right timeline depends on the hernia type, repair complexity, and your baseline fitness.

Florida Surgical Specialists provides individualized guidance for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**.

## Early movement: usually encouraged
For many patients, gentle movement is helpful:
- Walking as tolerated
- Light daily activity
- Gradual increase in time and distance

## Returning to higher-intensity exercise
Your surgeon will guide when it’s appropriate to resume:
- Jogging or cycling
- Core work
- Weight training
- Sports with twisting or contact

A key principle is staged progression: you rebuild activity in steps rather than “all at once.”

## Signs you may be doing too much
Call your surgeon if you notice:
- Increasing pain that doesn’t improve with rest
- New bulging at the repair site
- Worsening swelling or redness
- Symptoms that significantly set you back day-to-day

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you’re active and want a clear plan for returning to exercise, we’ll tailor guidance to your goals.
