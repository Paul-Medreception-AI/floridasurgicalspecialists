# Same-Week Hernia Surgery

If you’re dealing with worsening hernia symptoms, work limitations, or an enlarging bulge, waiting weeks for answers can be frustrating. Many patients want to know whether **same-week consultation** and efficient scheduling for hernia repair may be possible.

Florida Surgical Specialists emphasizes **rapid access** for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**, and our **AI-answered phones** help support **no missed calls** when you’re trying to reach us.

## Who may need faster evaluation
We prioritize timely evaluation when patients report:
- Increasing pain or pressure
- A hernia that’s clearly enlarging
- Symptoms that affect work or caregiving
- A recurrent hernia after prior repair

Emergency symptoms still require urgent evaluation (ER).

## What “same-week” can realistically mean
Availability depends on:
- Your symptoms and medical history
- Required pre-op evaluation/testing
- Surgical complexity
- Scheduling and facility availability

We’ll work with you to choose the safest timeline—not just the fastest.

## Schedule a Hernia Consultation
If you need answers quickly, start with a surgical consultation.
