# Inguinal Hernia

An inguinal hernia occurs when tissue pushes through a weak spot in the lower abdominal wall near the groin. It’s one of the most common hernia types, especially in men—but it can occur in anyone.

Florida Surgical Specialists provides patient-focused inguinal hernia evaluation and repair for people across **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**.

## Common symptoms
Many patients describe:
- A bulge in the groin that may come and go
- Pressure or pulling with activity
- Discomfort when standing for long periods
- Pain with lifting, coughing, or sneezing

If the bulge becomes firm and painful or you develop nausea/vomiting, that can signal a more urgent problem.

## What makes an inguinal hernia worse?
Inguinal hernias often enlarge over time, especially with:
- Heavy lifting or repetitive straining
- Chronic cough
- Constipation and straining with bowel movements
- Weight gain

## Treatment options
Your plan depends on symptoms, hernia size, and your goals:
- **Watchful waiting** (selected cases)
- **Surgical repair** (often recommended when symptoms are present)

Surgery may be performed using:
- **Laparoscopic repair**
- **Robotic repair** (helpful for certain anatomy, recurrent hernias, or complex cases)
- Open repair (when appropriate)

We’ll discuss mesh and non-mesh considerations based on your specific situation and surgeon guidance.
