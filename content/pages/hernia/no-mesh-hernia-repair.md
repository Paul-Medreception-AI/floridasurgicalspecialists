# No-Mesh Hernia Repair

Some patients prefer to avoid mesh and ask whether a “no-mesh” hernia repair is possible. The safest answer is: **sometimes**, depending on the hernia and your individual risk factors.

Florida Surgical Specialists provides clear, surgeon-led guidance for patients in **Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota**—focused on choosing a repair that’s both safe and durable.

## When no-mesh repair may be considered
No-mesh repair may be considered when:
- The defect is small
- Tissue quality is strong
- Recurrence risk is low
- The hernia type and anatomy are suitable

## When mesh may be recommended
Mesh may be recommended when:
- The defect is larger
- There is an incisional hernia
- The hernia is recurrent
- Tissue quality is weaker or under higher stress
- Durability is a priority due to work demands or lifestyle

## How the decision is made
A consultation helps answer:
- What type of hernia do you have?
- How large is it and what’s the tissue quality?
- What is your recurrence risk with and without reinforcement?
- Which approach best fits your goals and health?
