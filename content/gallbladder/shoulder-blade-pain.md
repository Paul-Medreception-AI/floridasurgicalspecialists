# Shoulder Blade Pain

Gallbladder pain often radiates to the right shoulder blade or upper back. This referred pain pattern can be confusing, but it is a classic gallbladder symptom.

## Why pain travels
The gallbladder shares nerve pathways with the shoulder area, which can cause pain to be felt away from the abdomen. Patients often notice it during gallstone attacks or biliary colic.

## Evaluation
We assess symptom timing, meal triggers, and associated nausea or abdominal pain. Imaging such as ultrasound helps confirm gallbladder disease.

## Treatment
Once gallbladder disease is confirmed, minimally invasive surgery provides lasting relief. Our practice offers robotic expertise and timely scheduling for appropriate cases.
