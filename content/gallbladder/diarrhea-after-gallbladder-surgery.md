# Diarrhea After Gallbladder Surgery

Some patients experience diarrhea after gallbladder removal. This is usually temporary and improves as the digestive system adapts.

## Why it happens
Without a gallbladder, bile flows continuously into the intestine. This can change digestion and stool consistency, especially with high-fat meals.

## How to manage it
Smaller meals, lower-fat choices, and hydration can help. We provide guidance and adjust your plan if symptoms persist.

## When to call
Persistent diarrhea or weight loss should be evaluated. Our team is available with AI-answered phones and rapid access to care.
