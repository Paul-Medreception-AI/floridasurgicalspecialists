# Bloating

Bloating after eating is common in gallbladder disease, particularly when bile flow is disrupted. Many patients in Sarasota and Bradenton notice fullness, pressure, or discomfort after meals.

## Why bloating happens
When bile cannot flow normally, digestion of fats becomes less efficient. This can create gas, fullness, and abdominal distension, sometimes alongside pain or nausea.

## Evaluation
We review diet triggers, timing, and associated symptoms. Ultrasound and HIDA scans help determine if the gallbladder is the source.

## Treatment
If gallbladder disease is confirmed, surgery often improves digestion and reduces bloating. We offer minimally invasive and robotic surgery with rapid access for eligible patients.
