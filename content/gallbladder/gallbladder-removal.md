# Gallbladder Removal

Gallbladder removal is the definitive treatment for symptomatic gallbladder disease. It prevents recurrent attacks and complications caused by stones or inflammation.

## When removal is recommended
We recommend surgery for recurring gallstone attacks, cholecystitis, gallbladder dysfunction, or bile duct complications. The goal is to prevent future emergencies.

## Surgical approach
Most patients are candidates for minimally invasive surgery, including laparoscopic and robotic techniques. These approaches reduce pain and speed recovery.

## Recovery expectations
Many patients return to light activity within days and normal routines within a few weeks. We provide detailed postoperative guidance and local follow-up.
