SEO Title: Normal Imaging but Gallbladder Pain Persists | Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, Sarasota
Meta Description: If imaging is normal but gallbladder pain persists, functional disease may be the cause. Learn next steps in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.

# Normal Imaging but Pain Persists

Some patients have classic gallbladder symptoms even when ultrasound appears normal. This can indicate functional gallbladder disease or subtle pathology not seen on initial imaging.

## Why imaging can be normal
Small stones, sludge, or gallbladder dysfunction may not be evident on ultrasound. Symptoms and a careful history remain important.

## Next diagnostic steps
A HIDA scan can measure gallbladder ejection fraction and reveal abnormal function. Additional labs or CT imaging may also be helpful.

## Treatment
When symptoms and functional testing align, gallbladder removal can provide lasting relief. We offer minimally invasive and robotic options with rapid access.
