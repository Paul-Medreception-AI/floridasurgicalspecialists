# Acute vs Chronic Gallbladder Disease

Gallbladder disease can show up as a sudden, severe attack or as a persistent, recurring problem. Understanding the difference helps guide the right timing for treatment.

## Acute disease
Acute gallbladder disease is sudden and intense, often with severe right upper abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. It can require urgent evaluation and quick intervention.

## Chronic disease
Chronic gallbladder disease reflects repeated inflammation. Symptoms may be milder but frequent, including post-meal pain, bloating, or food intolerance.

## Treatment decisions
Whether acute or chronic, a diseased gallbladder rarely improves long-term without surgery. We evaluate your history and imaging to recommend the safest plan with minimal downtime.
