Meta Description: Gallbladder sludge can cause pain and nausea similar to gallstones. Learn symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.

# Gallbladder Sludge

Gallbladder sludge is a thick mixture of bile and particles that can collect in the gallbladder. It may trigger pain, nausea, or inflammation even when stones are not present.

## How sludge causes symptoms
Sludge can intermittently block bile flow and mimic gallstone attacks. Patients often report post-meal right upper abdominal pain or discomfort that gradually worsens.

## Diagnosis
Ultrasound can identify sludge, though it may be subtle. If your symptoms are consistent, we evaluate additional tests such as HIDA scans to assess gallbladder function.

## Treatment approach
If sludge is causing repeated symptoms, gallbladder removal is the definitive treatment. We offer minimally invasive and robotic options with rapid scheduling in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.

**Schedule a Gallbladder Consultation** to review your imaging and symptoms. Our AI-answered phones ensure no missed calls.
