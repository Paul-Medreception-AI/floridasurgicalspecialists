# Gallstones

Gallstones are hardened deposits that can block bile flow and trigger intense, episodic pain. Patients in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota often describe sudden right upper abdominal pain after meals or at night.

## Why gallstones cause symptoms
When a stone blocks the cystic duct, the gallbladder squeezes against an obstruction. This can create sharp pain, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. Repeated attacks can lead to inflammation or infection.

## Diagnosis and next steps
Ultrasound is usually the first test, and it is excellent at detecting stones. If your symptoms match, we review your imaging and guide you toward the least invasive treatment that solves the problem.

## Surgical options
Most patients benefit from minimally invasive gallbladder removal. We offer laparoscopic and robotic approaches and prioritize rapid access, including timely scheduling when appropriate.
