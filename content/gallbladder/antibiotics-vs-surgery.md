# Antibiotics vs Surgery

Antibiotics can treat infection, but they do not remove gallstones or fix gallbladder dysfunction. Understanding the difference helps you make an informed decision.

## When antibiotics help
Antibiotics are used for acute infection or inflammation, such as cholecystitis. They stabilize the condition and reduce immediate risk.
