# Blood Tests

Blood tests are an important part of diagnosing gallbladder disease. They help detect inflammation, infection, and bile duct blockage.

We often check white blood cell counts, liver enzymes, and bilirubin. Abnormal results can point to cholecystitis or a blocked bile duct.

## When testing is needed
Blood tests are especially helpful when you have fever, severe pain, or jaundice. They guide urgency and next steps.

## Treatment decisions
Lab results inform whether antibiotics are needed and whether surgical treatment should be expedited. We coordinate care to move quickly when necessary.
