SEO Title: Pain After Eating and Gallbladder Disease | Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, Sarasota
Meta Description: Post-meal abdominal pain can signal gallbladder problems. Learn causes, testing, and treatment in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.

# Pain After Eating

If you feel pain after meals, especially fatty foods, the gallbladder is often the culprit. This pattern is common in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota patients with gallstones or biliary colic.

## Why meals trigger symptoms
Eating stimulates gallbladder contraction. If bile flow is blocked by stones or sludge, the gallbladder squeezes against resistance, causing pain and nausea.

## Evaluation
We review timing, severity, and food triggers, then order ultrasound or HIDA scan as needed. Clear testing helps distinguish gallbladder disease from acid reflux or other conditions.

## Treatment options
When the gallbladder is the source, minimally invasive removal offers lasting relief. We provide timely surgical options and robotic expertise when appropriate.

**Schedule a Gallbladder Consultation** to discuss post-meal pain with Florida Surgical Specialists. Our AI-answered phones mean no missed calls.
