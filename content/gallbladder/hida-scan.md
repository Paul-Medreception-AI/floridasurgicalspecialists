SEO Title: HIDA Scan for Gallbladder Disease | Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, Sarasota
Meta Description: A HIDA scan evaluates gallbladder function when ultrasound is unclear. Learn how it works and what results mean in Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.

# HIDA Scan

A HIDA scan measures gallbladder function and bile flow. It is useful when symptoms suggest gallbladder disease but ultrasound results are normal or unclear.

## What the test shows
The scan tracks how bile moves from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. Low gallbladder ejection fraction can signal functional gallbladder disease.

## When we recommend a HIDA scan
If pain persists after meals or you have biliary symptoms without visible stones, a HIDA scan provides additional clarity.

## Treatment decisions
Abnormal HIDA results combined with symptoms often support surgical treatment. We offer minimally invasive and robotic gallbladder surgery with rapid scheduling.
