Meta Description: Learn the symptoms and risks of a blocked bile duct and how urgent surgical care can prevent complications. Serving Bradenton, Lakewood Ranch, and Sarasota.

# Blocked Bile Duct

A blocked bile duct can occur when gallstones migrate into the common bile duct. This can cause jaundice, severe pain, fever, and infection.

## Why a blockage is serious
Bile duct obstruction can lead to cholangitis or pancreatitis. These conditions can become dangerous quickly and require urgent evaluation.

## How we diagnose
We use blood tests and imaging such as ultrasound, CT, or specialized studies to confirm the blockage. Coordinated care helps address the obstruction and then treat the gallbladder source.

## Treatment
Patients may need endoscopic stone removal followed by gallbladder surgery. We coordinate with specialists and offer timely surgical care when safe and appropriate.
