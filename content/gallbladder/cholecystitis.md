# Cholecystitis

Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, often triggered by a blockage from gallstones. It can present as severe, persistent right upper abdominal pain, fever, and nausea.

## Acute vs chronic inflammation
Acute cholecystitis is a sudden, intense episode that often requires urgent evaluation. Chronic cholecystitis reflects repeated attacks that damage the gallbladder and cause ongoing discomfort.

## How we evaluate cholecystitis
We combine a focused exam with labs and imaging, usually ultrasound and sometimes a HIDA scan. The goal is to identify inflammation and plan a safe, timely treatment.

## Treatment approach
Antibiotics can stabilize infection, but definitive care often requires gallbladder removal. Our team offers laparoscopic and robotic options with timely scheduling availability when appropriate.
