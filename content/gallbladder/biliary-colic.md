# Biliary Colic

Biliary colic is a pattern of severe, cramping pain caused by transient gallbladder blockage, most often from gallstones. Pain typically starts after meals and can radiate to the back or shoulder blade.

## What biliary colic feels like
Patients in Sarasota and Lakewood Ranch often describe a sudden, intense wave of right upper abdominal pain that lasts 30 minutes to several hours. It may be accompanied by nausea or sweating.

## Why it matters
Even if the pain resolves, biliary colic signals a mechanical problem with the gallbladder. Recurrent episodes increase the risk of cholecystitis or bile duct obstruction.

## Treatment options
When symptoms are consistent with biliary colic, gallbladder removal is the definitive solution. Our team offers minimally invasive and robotic approaches with prompt scheduling when appropriate.
