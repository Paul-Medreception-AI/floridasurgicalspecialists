# Long-Term Digestion

Most patients digest food normally after gallbladder removal. The liver continues to make bile, which flows directly into the intestine.

## What changes to expect
Some people notice temporary sensitivity to fatty foods or changes in bowel habits. Over time, the digestive system adapts and symptoms typically improve.
