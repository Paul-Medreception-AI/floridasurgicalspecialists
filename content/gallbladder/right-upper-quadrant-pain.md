# Right Upper Quadrant Pain

Pain beneath the right rib cage is a classic sign of gallbladder disease. It often appears after meals and can radiate toward the back or right shoulder.

## Common gallbladder-related causes
Gallstones, biliary colic, and cholecystitis are frequent causes of right upper quadrant pain. We also consider other conditions and use targeted imaging to confirm the source.

## How we evaluate
We review your symptom pattern, exam findings, and labs, then order an ultrasound or HIDA scan when indicated. The goal is to confirm the diagnosis and avoid unnecessary delays.

## Treatment
If gallbladder disease is confirmed, minimally invasive surgery is often the most reliable solution. We offer laparoscopic and robotic approaches with prompt scheduling options.
