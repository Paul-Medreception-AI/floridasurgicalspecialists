## Umashankkar Kannan, M.D.

**Current Employment Status:** NYCHHC/Metropolitan Hospital - Bronx, NY

Dr. Kannan came to us after completing a post-graduate MBA at Mercy College. Prior to that, he completed his general surgery training at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY, and Hospital of University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA. Currently, he is a Clinical Fellow in Bariatric Surgery at Mount Sinai Morningside in New York, working as an independent surgeon as well as continuing his research pursuits. In his words, "I completed my advanced general surgery fellowship at Florida Surgical Specialists between 2019-2020. Since then I have completed additional training in bariatric surgery and currently working at one of the NY City Health + Hospitals. Good fellowship training forms the basis for confidence in practice and the training with Drs. Toomey and Das have prepared me adequately for independent practice. I had good exposure to a wide gamut of general and colorectal diseases managed with appropriate mix of laparoscopic and robotic approaches. Also, I had sufficient experience in basic upper endoscopy and colonoscopy."
