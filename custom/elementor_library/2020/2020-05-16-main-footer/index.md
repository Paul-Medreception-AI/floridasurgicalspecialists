He's very professional, knowledgeable, kind and has a sense of humor. I recovered quickly from my surgery with little pain. His nurse, Christie, returned all my calls in a timely manner. His Lakewood Ranch office is clean and beautiful. I would definitely refer Dr. Toomey to my family and friends. Thank you also to the nurses and the front desk receptionist in the Manatee Surgical Care for their outstanding care. Mahalia A.Verified Patient Recently being diagnosed with breast cancer has been overwhelming to say the least. Dr. Toomey and his staff always take their time to explain what to expect and are always reassuring. I know I can call at any time the need arises. I was so impressed with his surgical skills as I was terrified to look after surgery, but wow! Nice work :) Lastly, they always make me smile even if my reason for being their is nothing to smile about. Thank you for that. Tamra T.Verified Patient Walking into Dr Toomey’s office was like a breath of fresh air. His front office staff made you feel welcome. His nurses and back office staff was friendly. Dr. Toomey, instantly put your mind at ease. He took his time explaining my condition and gave me time to ask any questions or address any of my concerns. I will highly recommend him.
